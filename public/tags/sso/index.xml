      <description>It all began that day&amp;hellip; when we decided to use a SSO called Keycloak for all the server services that we have, such as Grafana, Gitea, Portainer, Cloudflare Tunnels&amp;hellip; It was all going great, so well in fact, that we decided to remove the root account in Portainer in favour of the new fancy SSO, so we all got our new administrator accounts and all well and good, right?&#xA;Wrong. Apparently the username that is given inside Portainer is the key to all, and if changed, Portainer wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to ID the user, therefore, kicking them out.</description>
